        <h1>Eylem Yankı Aydemir</h1>
        <p>I am Eylem Yankı Aydemir. I'm studying software engineering at Nişantaşı University, and my primary goal is to become a game developer. <br/>
            Currently, I am proficient in using Unreal Engine 5, and I am actively taking Blender lessons to enhance my skills. <br/>
            During my first year of studies, I attended Atılım University, majoring in electrical and electronics engineering. <br/>
            However, after completing C classes at that school, I realized my passion lies more in software development. <br/>
            Consequently, I transferred to Nişantaşı University and changed my major.<br/><br/>
            
            I have gained proficiency in Java, C, and Python. <br/>
            I have applied my knowledge by creating automation systems with Java GUI, developing games and calculators, and working on embedded software projects with C. 
            Additionally, I pursued further education by attending a foreign language course in England, where I obtained a certificate.</p>
